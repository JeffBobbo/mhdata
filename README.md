# mhdata
Collections of data for the Monster Hunter games, specifically the Freedom series (and Portable 3<sup>rd</sup>). For general purposes (but mostly for the folks at [Hunster Verse](hunsterverse.net))

## Data structure
* `data/` contains original source data, collected from various places such as [MH Wikia](monsterhunter.wikia.com), [atwiki](https://www41.atwiki.jp/mhp2g), from the games themselves or players.
* `scripts/` contains scripts for reworking the data into usable formats.

Each game has it's own directory, and contains relevant data for that game. The inidividual files have the same format between games to keep processing simple.

## Todo
A list of things to be done can be found in the issues. Contribution is welcomed.
